1st step :
-I downloaded the API by using the library googletrans
Because it is an old library, i needed to download a new version, with this line on the terminal :

py -m pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1

So, I use a very easy library that i would talk more later

2st step :
-I downloaded the library Flask on python with this line on the terminal :
py -m pip install Flask
I wrote the basic code to run it (only 7 lines !) then i started to learn about the syntax and everything else on :

3rd step :
- I build the shape of the website, without adding my translator
